Have Konto create customer profile and deliver both an electronic invoice to customer's inbox and a claim to the customer's eBank.

== With this plugin ==

In the checkout process, the customer can choose to get an electronic invoice (PDF) sent to their inbox and for the invoice to appear in their eBank - where they make their payment.

Konto users will have Konto automatically store customer info, generate an invoice and bill their customers in their respective eBank. Konto provides connections to bookkeeping applications like Navision and makes it more easy than ever before to generate a legit invoice, bill customers, monitor payment and book the transaction in your choice of accounting solutions.

Note: The plugin requires that Konto users have an API key.
